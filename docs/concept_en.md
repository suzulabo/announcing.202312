# Announcing

Probably the most boring web service in the world

## Concept

Announcing is a web service that allows anyone to easily publish announcements with a feel similar to social media.  
Unfortunately, it doesn't have the following features:

- Like buttons
- Reposts or quote posts
- Replies
- Impression tracking

You can’t go viral (or get canceled) after spending all night on the perfect post.  
You also can’t keep checking likes or impressions every 10 minutes.  
And you can't be disappointed by a complete lack of reactions.

Once you have created a channel, share the URL with everyone.  
For example, it would be a good idea to put a QR code on the wall of your store.  
No app or membership registration is required to read the announcements.  
There is no need for standard conversations such as “Please follow me!” or “Sorry, I don't do that app.”

Readers can only read channels they know.  
There is no feature that monitors your actions and automatically shows you impactful ads, nor is there any feature that tries to steer you toward anything.

Announcing is not a service that replaces social media.  
Social media is a powerful tool for spreading information. It allows you to get direct feedback and communicate directly with others.  
Announcing is a service that complements social media for people who are not covered by social media.  
However, if you don't see the benefits of the above features of social media, Announcing alone may be sufficient.

Announcing is completely free to use.  
In the future, we aim to operate on a donation-based model.
