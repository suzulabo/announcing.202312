# Announcing

Probably the most boring web service in the world

## Concept

Announcing is a web service that allows anyone to easily publish announcements with a feel similar to social media. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the following features:

- Like buttons
- Reposts or quote posts
- Replies
- Impression tracking

You can’t go viral (or get canceled) after spending all night on the perfect post.  
You also can’t keep checking likes or impressions every 10 minutes.  
And you won't be disappointed by a complete lack of reactions.

You can share announcements with people you want to read them by giving them the URL of your channel.  
It's a good idea to put a QR code on the wall of your store (you'll have to do this yourself).  
Announcing works without an app, and no registration is required to read it.  
You won't have those classic conversations like, “Please follow me!” or “Sorry, I don't do that app.”  

Readers can only view channels they already know about.  
There's no feature that understands your hobbies, thoughts, or even your quirks, automatically showing you impactful posts or cleverly disguised ads.

### Is Announcing a Replacement for Social Media?

No.  
Social media services are powerful for building connections and spreading information, allowing you to get direct reactions from readers and communicate directly. Announcing is designed to complement those social media services by covering people they don't reach.  
However, if you don't see the benefits of the social media features mentioned above, Announcing might be all you need.

### Is it Free to Use?
Yes, it's completely free to use. In the future, we aim to operate on a donation-based model.
