# Announcing

Probably the most boring web service in the world

## Concept

Announcing is a web service that lets anyone publish announcements in a way similar to social media.  
Unfortunately, it doesn’t include the following features:

- Like buttons
- Reposts or quote posts
- Replies
- Impression tracking

You can’t go viral (or get canceled) after spending all night on the perfect post.  
You also can’t keep checking likes or impressions every 10 minutes.  
And you can't be disappointed by a complete lack of reactions.

Once you’ve created a channel, just share the URL.  
For example, printing a QR code and posting it at your store might be a good idea.  
No app or account is required to read announcements.  
No need for common exchanges like “Please follow me!” or “Sorry, I don’t use that app.”

Readers can only read channels they know.  
There are no features that monitor your actions, show you ads, or try to steer your behavior.
Announcing isn't a service that replaces social media.  
Social media is powerful—it lets you spread information, get feedback, and communicate.  
Announcing complements social media for people who feel it doesn’t suit them.  
But if you don’t see value in those social features, Announcing might be enough on its own.

Announcing is completely free to use.  
In the future, we aim to operate on a donation-based model.
